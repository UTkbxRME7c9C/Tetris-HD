**Brief Project Description:**
We are going to be making Tetris in Processing. You play Tetris by trying to fill out and removing rows using tetrominoes. Tetrominoes are tetris shapes made with 4 blocks: I, O, T, S, L, Z, and J. You lose when tetrominoes fill up to the top of the screen. The tetris screen size is 10 by 20. When a row is filled with 10 blocks made by the tetrominoes, it gets removed and the rest of the blocks get shifted down. We will include different versions of tetris including the traditional version and more.
